# MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJ-S

CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION MODEL 
LINEAR & LASSO REGRESSION 

The car_Price_Prediction project uses a machine learning model that is generated using linear regression and lasso regression . 
The dataset is obtained from kaggle .

Packages such as -
1. nunmpy - was used to perform feature scaling ( optional )
2. pandas - was used to call the car_data.csv file and perform operations on it .
3. matplotlib.pyplot - was used to visualize and create plots . Helps to know how the model is working and if the predicted and the actual values follow the x=y line . 
4. seaborn - used for the same function as matplotlib
5. sklearn - The most important and the most used package . It has all the modules like LinearRegression , Lasoo , Metrics and also train_test_split . 
were used .

'Selling_price' column was taken as the predicted values and was named as Y .
The remaining dataframe ( Car_Name and the Selling_price removed ) was named X . ( The car_name column was removed since it had no impact on the selling price )

 - 'train_test_split' module was used to directly generate 2 sets of data . One was named Train and the other was named Test . 
Train_set was used to train the linear regression model , while the other was used to test it . 

One could easily predict the values without using the whole gradient descent method and just using sklearn package( makes the job a whole lot easier but does'nt help to understand how it works )
One must know how gradient descent algorithm works and must know how to use the adam optimizer in it .

We can check to how much extent the predicted values are correct by using metrics .
Metrics has different methods to calculate error ( mean_squared_error , mean_squared_error_log , r2_score and etc ) . In this case we've used r2_score .

Then use matplotlib to plot the graph between predicted values and the actual values , if the best fit line of teh grwaph is somewhat close to the x=y line then the model works good enough . 

You can do this same prediction by using lasso regresion model instead of linear regression .

PERFORM all these operations on the test set as well and plot their graphs too .
